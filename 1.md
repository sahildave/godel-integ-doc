#2 - JusPay Safe Browser - Embeddable Browser for Apps (Android only):

JusPay Safe Browser was built to reduce the friction in the Second factor authentication process (3D secure and Netbanking) by addressing various convenience features and to give merchants a deeper insight into the payments conversion funnel (after hitting the Pay button). Payment conversions on Mobile apps are close to 50% in many cases and we squarely aim at solving this issue with the JusPay Safe Browser.

List of features:
Important user experience improvements done by the browser include 
    Auto OTP Processing on Bank pages. 
    Show password helper fragment.
    Showing the right keyboard for any input field on bank pages
    Auto scroll & auto focus 
    Remembering UserID for Netbanking with user's permission
    Updates to support new and changed bank pages, without requiring an app update. 
    Various other tweaks that eliminate or simplify the user interaction with the pages.
    Network optimization (primarily targeting 2G users) -  We employ various ways to speed up and smoothen the payment experience by reducing network utilization and other optimizations.

Features that are currently being built:
     Unblocker workflows - this is one of our current focus domains. We will be providing automatic and instant help in un-blocking customers stuck at various stages of the payment cycle ( forgotten password, mobile number not registered, forgotten user id, bad network connection etc). 
     Anti-Phishing feature. maintains a white/black/gray list of bank & pg domains
     Secure keyboard - prevents key logging or transmission of user credentials to the cloud
      

Analytics Dashboard:
We collect a slew of info during the payment process that gives you a deep insight and analytics. We provide conversion funnels for all payment instruments supported and a bunch of other metrics to slice-n-dice the  data collected.
